… Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming!
Rumbling, Rumbling!
Beware!
Coming for you!
… All I ever wanted to do was do right things
I never wanted to be the king, I swear
All I ever wanted to do was save your life
I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear

… I'm tearless, I'm fearless
I'm burning, I'm burning
You tell me what have I missed?
Still wandering in the deep mist
